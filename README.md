# Full Cycle Challenge - CI Pipeline with SonarCloud ðŸš€

## Challenge and Objectives ðŸ“‹

In this challenge, we will consolidate knowledge in creating a continuous integration (CI) pipeline by following these steps:

1. **Creation of the Node.js Application:**
   - Develop a small and simple Node.js application. It can be any application for the purposes of this challenge.

2. **Unit Tests:**
   - Create comprehensive unit tests to ensure the quality of the application.

3. **Configuration of CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions:**
   - Configure a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to perform the following steps:
     - Install the application
     - Run unit tests
     - Run code analysis with SonarCloud

4. **Public Repository on GitHub:**
   - Upload the application to a public repository on GitHub.

5. **Status Check and Quality Gate:**
   - Activate the status check to ensure that the application can only be merged if it passes the CI pipeline and meets the quality gate of SonarCloud.

6. **Creation of Pull Request:**
   - Create a Pull Request (PR) that encompasses the entire process described above.

7. **PR Link for Review:**
   - Provide the link to the PR below for our review.

## Execution Result:
  - In the pull request below, a failure simulation of the quality and security gates was performed to validate the branch protection rule with the require status checks to pass before merging with the Status checks that are required enabled.
